🚀 **Project Showcase: Lexical Analyzer in C**

I’m happy to share a new milestone in my journey toward systems programming and compiler development — I’ve built a **Lexical Analyzer using C** that mimics the first phase of a compiler.

---

### 🔧 What does it do?

This lexical analyzer reads raw source code and breaks it down into meaningful tokens. It can detect and classify:

* 🔹 **Keywords** (`int`, `return`, etc.)
* 🔹 **Identifiers**
* 🔹 **Numeric values**
* 🔹 **Single & double character operators** (`+`, `==`, `<=`, etc.)
* 🔹 **Special symbols & separators**

It also includes **basic syntax validation** by checking:

* ✔ Balanced `()` parentheses
* ✔ Balanced `{}` curly braces
* ❌ Reports warnings for missing or unbalanced symbols

---

### 🧠 Why I built it:

Working on this project helped me better understand:

* How compilers interpret source code
* Token classification logic
* File handling in C
* Error reporting mechanisms
* The importance of structured and maintainable code in low-level software

---

### 🛠️ Tech & Concepts Used:

* C Programming
* Tokenization Algorithms
* Compiler Design Basics
* Dynamic Memory Handling
* String Processing
* Error Detection Logic

I'm excited to continue improving this project and learning more about compilers and interpreters.
Any feedback, suggestions, or collaboration ideas are welcome 😊
